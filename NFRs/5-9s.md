# Five 9s Availability

Ensuring compliance with a High Availability Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) has important cost and complexity implications. It is important to understand the context of how much downtime is allowed under incremental increases beyond 99%.    

The values in the table below, under the % columns, indicate how many __*minutes*__ are allowed, for the given __*Time Period*__ and the % of Availability stipulated.

|Time Period  | 90.0%     | 99.0%     | 99.900% | 99.990%| 99.999%   |Max. Minutes Available |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|--------------|
|Day          |           |14.40      |1.44     |0.14    |0.01       |1,440         |
|Week         |           |100.80     |10.08    |1.01    |0.10       |10,080        |
