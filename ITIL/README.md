    * plan
    * improve
    * engage
    * design and transition
    * obtain/ build
    * deliver and support.

  + People (and, Organizations)
  + Products (and, Information)
  + Partners (and, Suppliers)
  + Processes (and, Value Streams)

- "ITIL processes are now named as practices... grouped as 14 general management practices, 17 service management practices, and three technical management practices."

- Guiding Principles:
  + "Focus on value - Generate value directly or indirectly."
  + "Start where you are - Preserve good capabilities and improve where needed."
  + "Progress iteratively with feedback - Improve often in small steps and measure your way forward."
  + "Collaborate and promote visibility - Transparent work in the teams, with the stakeholders and partners."
  + "Think and work holistically - It’s an End-to-End responsibility – the service and the SVS."
  + "Keep it simple and practical - The right size and use of processes, tools, resources matters."
  + "Optimize and automate - Manual work is a bug. Reserve human intervention only for really needed activities."

- "Three levels of continual improvement"
  + Improve service value chain activity
  + Continual improvement practice
  + Continual improvement model:
    * What is the vision?
    * Where are we now?
    * Where do we want to be?
    * How do we get there?
    * Take action
    * Did we get there?
    * How do we keep the momentum going?
