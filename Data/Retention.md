# Data Retention Guidelines

- How long should you retain certain types of data? This document is intended to be a catch-all for organizing notes related to general data retention guidelines - as well as links/citations of industry/regulatory/legal specific guidelines.

- What should you do with the data that you decide to purge from a real-time system?
  - Archive to "warm" storage (e.g. slower/cheaper read/write disks, compressed data that needs to be re-inflated, or databases that must be spun-up and started)?
  - Archive to "cold" storage (e.g. tape?)
  - Or, just mark the dat afor deletion - and have it scheduled to be physically deleted later?

- The following are suggested as examples only - your particular industry's regulatory and legal compliance requirements - as well as your country, state, county, city, etc. - should dictate your specific data retention requirements.
