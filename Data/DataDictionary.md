Data Dictionary Resources
====

In many instances, I've seen organizations purchase expensive/heavy-weight tools for the intended purpose of creating an Enterprise Data Dictionary - but, which is subsequently rarely (if ever) used by anyone outside of the data management team. 

This document is inteded as a collection of links to resources, and suggested ideas, for establishing and managing an Enterprise Data Dictionary - that can scale from the small, to the large. 

###Guiding Principles
* In general, the very concept of an Enterprise Data Dictionary is actually an anti-pattern. 
* The concept of a Data Dictionary is generally most applicable within a bounded context (e.g. as selected/defined for use in the design of a set of microservices)
