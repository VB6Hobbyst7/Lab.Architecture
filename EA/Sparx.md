Sparx Enterprise Architect (tool)




Note: When generating HTML reports out of Sparx, Chrome won't allow JavaScripot to be loaded if you try to run the HTML from the browser. You will need to deploy the HTML report to a web server. A similar problem appears to happen with IE 11 and MS Edge browsers.
