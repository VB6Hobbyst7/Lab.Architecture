  + Rules:
    1. The columns have no order: The columns are interchangeable but cannot be reduced or created
    2. Each column has a simple generic model: Every column can have its own meta-model
    3. The basic model of each column must be unique: The basic model of each column, the relationship objects and the structure of it is unique. Each relationship object is interdependent but the representation objective is unique.
    4. Each row describes a distinct, unique perspective: Each row describes the view of a particular business group and is unique to it. All rows are usually present in most hierarchical organizations.
    5. Each cell is unique: The combination of 2,3 & 4 must produce unique cells where each cell represents a particular case. Example: A2 represents business outputs as they represent what are to be eventually constructed.
    6. The composite or integration of all cell models in one row constitutes a complete model from the perspective of that row: For the same reason as for not adding rows and columns, changing the names may change the fundamental logical structure of the Framework.
    7. The logic is recursive: The logic is relational between two instances of the same entity.

  + The six rows of the Zachman Framework matrix include:
    1. ```Planner’s view (scope)```: This row is where you identify the business plan or strategy and establish what issue or concern will be addressed in the matrix.
    2. ```Owner’s view (business concepts)```: The second row is where you will identify business needs and the resources the business will need to execute the plan.
    3. ``` Designer’s view (system logic)```: The third row identifies how the plan will meet the business’ needs. This row corresponds to work done by systems analysts who handle the data, process flows and functions of business processes.
    4. ```Engineer’s perspective (technology physics)```: The fourth row includes relevant information about how to implement the strategy and what tools, technology, materials and constraints the team will be working with.
    5. ```Technician’s perspective (component assembly)```: This row is where you will include representations of requirements for products, services or hardware.
    6. ```User’s view (operations classes)```: The final row includes information about the functioning system and how it works in the IT or business environment.
  + The six columns of the Zachman Framework template include all of the questions that you’ll ask during the process:
    1. ```What (data)```: This is where you establish what business data, information and requirements are necessary for the project.
    2. ```How (function)```: The “how” or “function” column identifies how processes work and impact the business.
    3. ```Where (network)```: This column includes the “where,” which includes all system networks and relevant locations where business operations take place.
    4. ```Who (people)```: In column four you will identify the key stakeholders and determine all of the relevant personnel for the project.
    5. ```When (time)```: Column five is where you will identify when and at what time business processes are performed in the company.
    6. ```Why (motivation)```: The final column is where you will identify why you chose the final solution and what the motivation is behind the initiative or project.
