# Possible Vendor Solution Resources, for targeted enterprise business capabilities

This sub-directory of my Lab.Architecture repository is intended as a collection of reminders, list, and links to possible vendor solutions - for a number of different problem domains, and across multiple business-specific verticals. 

Often, during my client engagements - I am involved in the preliminary search/evaluation of potential vendor solutions - for solving large-scale enterprise business needs. Having these handy lists helps my ability to accelerate delivery of services to clients - and gives me a good starting point when I need to revisit a particular category.
