  * "WSO2 was founded by Dr. Sanjiva Weerawarana and Paul Fremantle in August, 2005, and has been backed by investment from Intel Capital, Toba Capital,Pacific Controls and others. As of 2015, WSO2 has offices in USA (Mountain View, CA; Bloomington, IN), UK (London) and Sri Lanka (Colombo), with the bulk of its research and operations being conducted from its main office in Palm Grove, Colombo"

  * ...based and expands on the [Apache Synapse ESB] (http://synapse.apache.org/)
  * ...designed to stream large data sets and be completely asynchronous and non-blocking. 
  * Inbound Endpoints support MQTT, HTTP, HTTPS, File, Java Message Service (JMS), Health Level 7 (HL7), Kafka, Apache CXF Reliable Messaging, and RabbitMQ protocols. 
  * https://store.wso2.com/store 
    * ...offers 100-plus connectors— including eBay, GitHub, Salesforce, and Twitter, among others—
  * ___Key Features of WSO2 ESB___
  1. Proxy services - facilitating synchronous/asynchronous transport, interface (WSDL/Schema/Policy), message format (SOAP 1.1/1.2, POX/REST, Text, Binary), QoS (WS-Addressing/WS-Security) and optimization switching (MTOM/SwA).
  2. API facilitating building REST services.
  3. Non-blocking HTTP/S transports based on Apache HttpCore for ultrafast execution and support for thousands of connections at high concurreny with constant memory usage.
  4. Built in Registry/Repository, facilitating dynamic updating and reloading of the configuration and associated resources (e.g. XSLTs, XSD, WSDL, Policies, JS, Configurations ..)
  5. Easily extendable via custom Java class (mediator and command)/Spring mediators, or BSF Scripting languages (Javascript, Ruby, Groovy, etc.)
  6. Built in support for scheduling tasks using the Quartz scheduler.
  7. Load-balancing (with or without sticky sessions)/Fail-over, and clustered Throttling and Caching support
  8. WS-Security, Caching & Throttling configurable via (message/operation/service level) WS-Policies
  9. Lightweight, XML and Web services centric messaging model
  10. Support for industrial standards (Hessian binary web service protocol/Financial Information eXchange protocol and optional Helth Level-7 protocol)
  11. Enhanced support for the VFS(File/FTP/SFTP)/JMS/Mail transports with optional TCP/UDP transports and transport switching for any of the above transports
  12. Support for message splitting & aggregation using the EIP and service callouts
  13. Database lookup & store support with DBMediators with reusable database connection pools
  14. Transactions support via the JMS transport and Transaction mediator for database mediators
  15. Internationalized GUI management console with user/permission management for configuration development and monitoring support with statistics, configurable logging and tracing
  16. JMX monitoring support and JMX management capabilities like, Gracefull/Forcefull shutdown/restart
  17. Inbound endpoint is  a message source that can be configured dynamically. Inbound endpoints support all transports to work in a multi-tenant mode. The behaviour of an inbound endpoint can be Polling, Busy wait or Listening based on the implementation
  18. Guaranteed message delivery pattern is supported with cluster coordination support added to the new Message store and Message processor implementation
  19. Message queueing protocol support has been extended with MQTT, RabbitMQ, Kafka and HL7 Inbound endpoint/transport implementations.
  20. Dynamic SSL profiles support added to configure keystores dynamically without even restarting the server
