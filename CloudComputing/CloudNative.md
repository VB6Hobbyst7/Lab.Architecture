## Reference
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_native_computing
  + "Cloud native computing is an approach in software development that utilizes cloud computing to its fullest due to its use of an open source software stack to deploy applications as microservices"
  + "Typically, cloud native applications are built as a set of microservices that run in Docker containers, orchestrated in Kubernetes and managed and deployed using DevOps and Git Ops workflows."
  + "The advantage of using Docker containers is the ability to package all software needed to execute into one executable package. The container runs in a virtualized environment, which isolates the contained application from its environment."

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_cloud_application
  + "A type of computer software that natively utilizes services and infrastructure from cloud computing providers such as Amazon EC2, Force.com, or Microsoft Azure. NCAs exhibit a combined usage of the three fundamental technologies:"
    * "Computational grid - loosely, e.g. MapReduce"
    * "Data grids (e.g. distributed in-memory data caches)"
    * "Auto-scaling on any managed infrastructure"

    * "Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach."
    * "These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil."

  + "Cloud-native is about how applications are created and deployed, not where"
  + Cloud Native Design Principles
    * "Designed As Loosely Coupled Microservices"
    * "Developed With Best-of-breed Languages And Frameworks"
    * "Centred Around APIs For Interaction And Collaboration"
    * "Stateless And Massively Scalable"
    * "Resiliency At The Core Of the Architecture"
    * "Packaged As Lightweight Containers And Orchestrated"
    * "Agile DevOps & Automation Using CI/CD"
    * "Elastic — Dynamic scale-up/down"

  + "Cloud-native computing takes advantage of many modern techniques, including PaaS, multicloud, microservices, agile methodology, containers, CI/CD, and devops"

- https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps
  + "Cloud-native applications are a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. They are designed to deliver well recognized business value, like the ability to rapidly incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement."
  + "If an app is "cloud-native," it’s specifically designed to provide a consistent development and automated management experience across private, public, and hybrid clouds"

- https://pivotal.io/cloud-native
  + "Cloud-native is an approach to building and running applications that exploits the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model. Cloud-native is about how applications are created and deployed, not where."
  + "Organizations require a platform for building and operating cloud-native applications and services that automates and integrates the concepts of DevOps, continuous delivery, microservices, and containers"
  + Benefits:
    * Predictable
    * OS abstraction
    * Right-sized capacity
    * Collaborative
    * Continuous delivery
    * Independent
    * Automated scalability
    * Rapid recovery
