12 Factor App Methodology
* http://12factor.net/
* https://github.com/heroku/12factor

```
The Twelve Factors
1. One Codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
2. Explicity declare and isolate dependencies
3. Store config in the environment
4. Treat backing services as attached resources
5. Strictly separate services as attached resources
6. Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
7. Export services via port binding
8. Scale out via the process model
9. Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
11. Treat logs as event streams
12. Run admin/management tasks as one-off-processes
