# EA Views - Title Block Ideas

- If you have ever spent much time looking at building architectural drawings - you'll have noted that there is a convention of placing a "Title Block" in the lower-right hand corner of the drawing. 
- I've done a brief survey of different diagrams - to gather some examples - as input to writing this document. 
- I think that the current state of annotating software design architectural drawings - is *abysmal* - and much might be leanred by looking left-and-right - and seeing how other industries annotate their diagrams.
