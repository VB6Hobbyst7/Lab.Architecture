    * "A system and method for ranking providers is provided. The method may include ranking information providers based on their focus and trust in specific keyword contexts. The focus trust rank assigned to a specific information provider may be calculated from their focus for a given keyword that is the subject of an information search. A provider's focus trust rank may additionally or alternatively be calculated based on one or more of the total keyword count set by the provider, the number of consumers who trust the provider, matching trust factors, or a measure of a maturity of the provider in a system using the method for ranking and, thus, filtering providers. Consumers may optionally be provided with the ability to apply their personalized list of focused and trusted providers to transform the results of a full text search such that their trusted providers always rank to the top and optionally can trust providers which are returned in the search."
