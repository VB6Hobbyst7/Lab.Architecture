    * "The first is an API specific media type. The vendor prefix (vnd.) indicates that it is custom for this vendor. The +json indicates that it can be parsed as JSON, but the media type should define further semantics on top of JSON."
    * "The second just means that the content is JSON. This is in general not very useful, though, because it does not define what the JSON values mean."
    * "The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type (or) media type is a standardized way to indicate the nature and format of a document transferred over the internet. It is standardized in IETF RFC 6838. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the official body responsible for keeping track of all official MIME types."
    * "The media type used by JSON API is application/vnd.api+json and it has been properly registered with IANA."
