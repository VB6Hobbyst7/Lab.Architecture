  * "The Seven Basic Principles of the Context-Driven School"
    * "The value of any practice depends on its context."
    * "There are good practices in context, but there are no best practices."
    * "People, working together, are the most important part of any project’s context."
    * "Projects unfold over time in ways that are often not predictable."
    * "The product is a solution. If the problem isn’t solved, the product doesn’t work."
    * "Good software testing is a challenging intellectual process."
    * "Only through judgment and skill, exercised cooperatively throughout the entire project, are we able to do the right things at the right times to effectively test our products."
