__Enterprise Architecture Heat Maps__

The purpose of an Enterprise Architecture Heat Map is to provide Enterprise Leadership (Business & Technical) with insights and visualization of important weights and trends that may be obscured, or at the very least - not as easily comprehended, by detail-level tabular reporting of metrics.


Some potential dimensions to consider for a Heat Map measurement/visualization...within the context of an Enterprise Technical Reference Model (TRM) - by system/component:
* Business/Organizational Survey of...
  * current systems/components performance
  * priority/value (to business) of improving systems/components performance
  * priority/value (to business) of replacing systems/components 
  * proiroty/value (to business) of removing systems/components
  * priority/value (to business) of renewing systems/components
  *...
* Capability of systems/components
  * Poorly Defined or Placed
  * Neeeds Action
  * Problematic, Needs Preventative Action
  * Working Well - No Change Neded
  * Non Existent 
  * Not Evaluated
  * ...
* Product Lifecycle Stage
  * End of Life
  * Last Generation
  * State of Market
  * Leading Edge
  * Emerging
  * In the Labs
  * ...
* Risks (as posed by an inventory of systems/components)
  * Business
  * Regulatory
  * Security
  * Competition
  * ...
* Enterprise Alignment assessment of systems/components (e.g. as contrasted against...)
  * Technical Reference Model
  * Enterprise Alignment
  * Technology Roadmap
  * ...
* Compliance with Enterprise Archtiecture Standards of systems/components
* Dollar Cost/Investment (
  * Initial Build Cost
  * Replacement Cost
  * Ongoing Maintenance Cost
* Business Revenue (vs. Cost) 
* Resource Allocation/Staffing
* Transaction Volumes (for a selected period; e.g. Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.)
* Data Volume 
  * Stored
  * Processed (e.g. Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.)
* Record Counts
* Memory Utilization, by systems/components
* CPU Utilization, by systems/components
* Interfaces/Integrations/Connections, by systems/components
* Services Exposed, by systems/components
* Services Consumed, by systems/components
* Frequency of New Feature Requests, by systems/components
* Frequency of Defects Reported, by systems/components
* Frequency of Changes Deployed
* Cyclomatic Complexity (within systems/components)
* Lines of Code (LoC), by systems/components
* Number of Source Files, by systems/components
* Number of Input Sources, by systems/components
* Number of Output Targets, by systems/components
* Availability (of systems/components)
* Average Response Time (of systems/components)
