Enterprise Architecture Heat Maps

The purpose of an Enterprise Architecture Heat Map is to provide Enterprise Leadership (Business & Technical) with insights and visualization of important weights and trends that may be obscured, or at the very least - not be as easily comprehended, by detail-level tabular reporting of metrics.


Some potential dimensions to consider for a Heat Map measurement/visualization of the details within the context of an Enterprise Technical Reference Model (TRM) - by system/component:
* Dollar Cost/Investment
* Resource Allocation/Staffing
* Transaction Volume (for a selected period; e.g. Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.)
* Data Volume (e.g. processed, stored, etc.)
* Memory Utilization
* CPU Utilization
* Interfaces/Integrations/Connections
* Frequency of New Feature Requests
* Frequency of Defects Reported
* Frequency of Changes Deployed
* Cyclomatic Complexity
* Lines of Code
* Number of Source Files
* Input Sources
* Output Targets
