Data Archiving Solution Criteria
======

There are some key questions that should be considered when defining the criteria for any data archival solution effort:


* How frequently must data be extracted for data archival (e.g. hourly? nightly? Weekly? monthly? one-time only?)
* How much data (e.g. in GB) must be archived?
  * For large data collection (e.g. TB, PB, etc.), what high performance delivery mechanisms are avaiable?
* What are the formats in which the data may be exported for import into an archive solution?
* How many distinct data entities are represented in the data to be archived?
  * For each data entity,how many records are to be archived?
  * For each data entity, what are the data types that must be archived?
  * For each data entity , What is the data classification assigned to it (e.g. Public, Confidential, PCI-DSS, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), HIPPA, Attorney-Client-Privilege, etc.)
  * Are there any associated data files (e.g. audio, video, etc.) that must be archived, and associated to records for a given data entity?
* What are the search capabilities that the archive solution must support (e.g. search by synthentic key, by account number, by last and first name, by address, by phone number, c.)
* Are there any busiess rules regarding the periodic purging of archived dat a (e.g. purge any records older than [n] years)
* How many users will need access to the data archive
* What are the Roles that the archive solution must support?
* What are the business rules regarding security / access permissions to the archived data?
* Must the archive solution support API-level access (e.g. by other systems)?
* Must the archive solution support a User Interface?
* Must the archive solution support integration with any Single-Sign-On (SSO) solution?
* What are the data encryption requirements for the archive solution?
* What is the expected frequency of access for the archive solution (e.g. per day, per week, etc.)?
* What is the expected volume of retrieval for the archive solution (e.g. per day, per week, etc.)?
* What impact may data archival processig (or retrieval) impose on existing network, server, and storage infrastructure?
* Are there any business requirements (or legal constraints) that may restrict where data archival storage may be implemented (e.g. must remain within the United States, must not be hosted in the cloud, etc.)
* Are there any commercial/proprietary solutions that are optimized for periodically extracting (and retrieving) data for an archive solution?
