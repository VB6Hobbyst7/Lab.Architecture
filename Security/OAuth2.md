    cloud native, security-first, open source API security for your

    * "ORY Hydra is a Certified OpenID Provider Server and implements all the
      requirements stated by the OpenID Foundation. In particular, it correctly
      implements the various OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows specified by the
      IETF and OpenID Foundation."
    * "ORY Hydra offers a safe storage for cryptographic keys (used for example
      to sign JSON Web Tokens) and can manage OAuth 2.0 Clients."
    * "ORY Hydra does not manage user accounts, i.e. user registration, password
      reset, user login, sending confirmation emails, etc. In Hydra's
      architecture, the Identity Provider is responsible for this."
    * "ORY Hydra doesn't support the OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password
      Credentials flow because it is legacy, discouraged, and insecure."
